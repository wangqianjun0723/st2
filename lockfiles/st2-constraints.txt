# Add/remove version constraints for transitive dependencies in this file
# (transitive dependencies are dependencies of our direct dependencies).

# Direct dependencies should be recorded in `requirements-pants.txt`, not here.

# pinned transitive deps from requirements.txt #

#
# required by jinja2:
# fixed-requirements.txt:
#     Fix MarkupSafe to < 2.1.0 as 2.1.0 removes soft_unicode
#     >=0.23 was from jinja2
MarkupSafe<2.1.0,>=0.23

# required by kombu:
# lockfile had 5.1.1 without this
amqp==5.0.6

# required by cryptography, paramiko, passlib:
# lockfile had 4.0.1 without this
bcrypt==3.2.0

# required by jsonpath-rw, networkx:
# fixed-requireements.txt:
#     networkx requires decorator>=4.3,<5 which should resolve to version 4.4.2
#     but the wheel on pypi does not say it supports python3.8, so pip gets
#     confused. For now, pin decorator to work around pip's confusion.
# lockfile had 4.4.2 without this (so this is just a pin)
#decorator==4.4.2
